      <p><strong>The Whales</strong></p>
      <p>Whales in the ocean have lived their lives developing sensitive hearing <br> to be able to hear their surroundings instead of needing to see.<br>The main reasons whales developed this ability is because of the distance <br> sound can travel in water and that light doesn't travel far in water.<br> Whales adapted to using echolocation and sounds to get their <br>surroundings long before people started using ships.</p>

      <p><strong>The Ships</strong></p>
      <p>Cargo ships are the leading method of commercial item transportation,<br> but they're also the loudest for the ocean creatures.<br> With the amount of goods needing to be transported increasing by the year,<br>shipping companies have been using more cargo ships<br> which have big propellers. The big propellers flood the ocean with sound<br> which whales and other sea creatures are harmfully affected by.</p>

      <p><strong>The Waves</strong></p>
      <p>The sound waves that whales are hearing are very loud. With how far<br> waves can travel in water the navy and scientists have been using waves<br> to map out the ocean. These waves are very loud so they can be recieved<br> to be used in a map. These loud waves damage the whales ability to hear<br> anything else. Sound waves are known as a type of transverse wave.</p>
